						<h2>FAQ</h2>
						<p>Please read our FAQ page which should cover the majority of issues you want to know about the race.</p>
						<p>Please also check the Race Day page and be sure to download the Race Pack document before heading out for the race.</p>
						<p>If your question is not answered here feel free to check for updates on our Facebook page or email us at info@stonemad.com.</p>
						<p><strong>What is Stonemad?</strong></p>
						<p>It is a marathon event, with 3 different race distances: Ultra 60km, Marathon and Half-Marathon. The route meanders along the flat and scenic banks of the River Barrow, starting in Carlow and finishing in the picturesque town of Graiguenamanagh.</p>
						<p><strong>Why is it called Stonemad?</strong></p>
						<p>StoneMad was originally a 2-Day event that took in place along the corridor of the River Barrow and up over the mountain path of Mount Leinster. The event derived its name from the nine historical stones at the top of Mount Leinster.</p>
						<p><strong>When does registration close?</strong></p>
						<p>Registration closes 1 week prior to the event at midnight Friday 9th June 2017.</p>
						<p><strong>Can I volunteer?</strong></p>
						<p>Yes! All volunteers are most welcome! Please contact us at info@stonemad.com and we will be in touch.</p>
						<p><strong>Is it all trail?</strong></p>
						<p>The route is on riverside track, soft trail and short grass, with short paved sections at road crossings.</p>
						<p><strong>Do I need trail shoes?</strong></p>
						<p>Either road or trail running shoes will be fine, depending on your personal preference.</p>
						<p><strong>Are there aid stations?</strong></p>
						<p>This is a self-sufficient race, with participants required to carry their own water and energy foods. However there are aid stations on average every 10km along the route where you can top up your water supplies, and enjoy other drinks and snacks to boost the energy levels! Your race number will be checked at each aid station.</p>
						<p><strong>What do I have to carry on the day?</strong></p>

						</ul>
						<p><strong>Can I walk or jog?</strong></p>
						<p>Yes! Walkers, joggers and runners are all welcome!</p>
						<p><strong>Am I ready for the ultra?</strong></p>
						<p>Do you have a beard?! Then of course you’re ready! For the rest of us average folk, if you have completed a marathon, are regularly doing long runs in training and can do this on back-to-back days, then you are probably ready! Our advice for your approach to your first ultra is to pace well, take walking breaks as needed, eat before you’re hungry, and drink to your thirst. There are many online training plans available which can be a helpful guide to increasing both physical and mental endurance. Best of luck! The StoneMad crew will be there to support you along the way and cheer you across that finish line!</p>
						<p><strong>Are there toilets along the course?</strong></p>
						<p>The route passes through many small towns where toilet facilities can be found if needed.</p>
						<p><strong>This is a point-to-point race, will there be a bag drop to the finish line?</strong></p>
						<p>Yes. Bags will be collected in the morning at registration and delivered to the finish line at Graiguenamanagh, where there are showers and changing facilities available for use in the scouts hall. We cannot accept responsibility for loss or damage, so please keep your valuables in a safe place.</p>
						<p><strong>Is there food available at the finish line?</strong></p>
						<p>Yes. There will be food at the scouts hall beside the finish line, please bring along a few euros and take your time soaking up the post race atmosphere!</p>
						<p><strong>Will I get a medal and T-shirt?</strong></p>
						<p>Yes, both!</p>
						<p><strong>Where can I park my car?</strong></p>
						<p>There are plenty of public parking options in Carlow Town and close to Carlow Rowing Club (registration point), with rates of approx 3euro per day. We recommend car-pooling where possible. </p>
						<p><strong>Do I have to take the bus or can I use my own transport?</strong></p>
						<p>Buses will depart regularly from the finish point back to Carlow Rowing Club (registration point/race start) in Carlow Town. Cost is €10, and tickets can be purchased online via the registration page. Those who have family, or their own transport from the finish, do not need to purchase tickets for the bus. Please note that there is minimal parking available at the finish point on the Quay in Graiguenamanagh, but there are other parking options available in the town.</p>
						<p><strong>Can I drop down a distance on race day?</strong></p>
						<p>It is possible to change category up until registration closing date of Friday 9th June, for a €5 admin fee. Race day changes are not permitted. Those running the ultra who finish a marathon distance only will be given their finish time but will be formally recorded as a DNF.</p>
						<p><strong>Is the race timed? </strong></p>
						<p>Yes. All results will be published online after the race.</p>
						<p><strong>I need to get in touch - what are the contact details for the race organizer?</strong></p>
						<p>Any queries can be posted to our facebook page, or to info@stonemad.com. Phone numbers for the race director and team members will be given at registration on race day.</p>
