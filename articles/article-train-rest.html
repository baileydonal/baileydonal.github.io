									<h3>Not feeling well? Maybe you need a day off.</h3>
								</header>
								<p>That’s a question that many of us have reluctantly found ourselves considering at some point. Sometimes we ask for advice already knowing exactly what we want to hear. When I’ve been coughing like a seal and shivering by the hottest radiator I can find, my thoughts have gone something like this:</p>
								<p><strong>I’ve trained, I’ve put in the hours, I’ve paid for the race, I got that awesome new gadget that I want to try out and… yes I’m sick but sure I’m tapering now anyway so I’ll probably get better before race day. Right?</strong></p>
								<p>Does that sound in any way familiar? Well, maybe I can add some rational counterpoints to that fever-induced nonsense which previously landed me on weeks of antibiotics for pneumonia!</p>
								<p>First of all, it’s not just you! <strong>About 1 in 5 of us runners will have some kind of an infection in the 8-12 days before our next race.</strong> Put another way, each of us will get a viral type illness just before one of our next 5 races. So now you know it’s coming, what do you need to know to make a decision?</p>
								<ul style="list-style-type:square">
									<li>If you get sick, you’ll probably get one or more of – sore throat, runny nose, fatigue, blocked nose, headaches, gastro problems.</li>
									<li>Systemic symptoms – 1 in 15 of us will have some mix of fever, chesty cough, general muscle and joint pain. These affect a large part of your body’s systems hence the name.</li>
									<li>‘The Neck Test’ – Systemic symptoms are generally below the level of the neck. If you have any symptoms below your neck, then your body fails ‘The Neck Test’. Let it relax for now.</li>
									<li>Complications – If you do vigorous training with a failed neck test, you’re playing Russian Roulette with getting much worse. Exercising hard temporarily reduces the function of your immune system; doing this at a time when your body is already struggling with an invader may allow it to get the upper hand resulting in complications such as inflammation around your heart, pneumonia (like I had) and so forth.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>Yeah, yeah, don’t get all Health and Safety on me! I’m going out there no matter what! What’ll happen?</strong></p>
								<p>I understand but don’t endorse. Most runners (85%) will race regardless of feeling poorly – whether they have just a runny nose or a feverish hacking cough.</p>
								<ul style="list-style-type:square">
									<li>DNF – Running a race with, or shortly after, an infection will double your chance of getting the dreaded ‘DNF’ beside your name.</li>
									<li>Your performance will suffer. Forget that PR. You won’t be as strong or as fast even up to 4 days after a viral illness has completely resolved so don’t be too disappointed with your time.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><h3>Is there any good news?</h3></p>
								<p>Most of us won’t be sick for our next race – hooray! If you are under the weather before a race or hard training day, think of the pros and cons from Never Bonk and make an informed decision. If you pass ‘The Neck Test’ then you might consider going out for an easy session.</p>
								<p>Enjoy your sport!</p>
