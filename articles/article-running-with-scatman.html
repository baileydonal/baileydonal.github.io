									<h3>Running with Scatman</h3>
								</header>
								<p>On February 18th 1998, the Ethiopian athlete Haile Gebrselassie ran a ferociously quick 2000m in a world record time of 4:52.86. Aside from being the world’s best, what helped him achieve that stellar speed? After the race, Gebrselassie indicated that he had synced his running cadence with the beat of the (love it or hate it) pop song ‘Scatman’. The song was famously played at many of his races. He is quoted:</p>
								<p><i>‘that Scatman music was perfect for the 10,000m world record. But you cannot play that one here in Ethiopia, because they have their own traditional music. But I did many records with the Scatman song. Fantastic. If you watch back some of my world records you can hear Scatman in the background. The rhythm was perfect for running.’</i></p>
								<p>Can we learn some lessons from Gebrselassie? Undoubtedly many. His marathon cadence was in the region of 197bpm, up there along with many elite runners. So let’s break this down to see what’s going on.</p>
								<p><strong>Music is generally accepted to have a positive effect on your training.</strong> It boosts mood and motivation (do you have that song, maybe Scatman, which you know will get you through a tough interval?), it focuses attention, evokes certain memories, and provokes emotion. These all contrive to increase power output and encourage rhythmic movement – even babies and toddlers have been studied to move their legs to the beat of music. The net effect is that music tends to improve time trial performance in training (in racing motivation tends to be pretty high already – the jury is still out on this).</p>

								<p>Any swimmers out there might have tried the trick of putting a waterproof metronome under your cap to train at a specified cadence. Also, cyclists are often obsessed with cadence drills – I know I was. There’s been a big push in training watches in the last few years to monitor cadence. We know that there the fastest, most efficient runners will run at a cadence above 180bpm. Do these benefits of metronomic training transfer to running?</p>
								<p>Some researchers thought it would be fun to test this by putting some very scientifically generous volunteers up on a treadmill to observe (maybe with popcorn) how their performance to exhaustion would change with no sound, a beep-beep metronome in sync with their running cadence, and finally with motivational music synced to their running cadence. I don’t know about you but the idea of running to exhaustion in a lab with no music or anything makes me shudder. Do you think the metronome would help you? Well, according to this study, the metronome and music were both equally way more effective than bitter silence. Although the music alone also lowered perceived exertional effort so music was the clear winner.</p>
								<p><strong>The theory is that the regular beat helps runners optimize running economy by easily sticking to a prescribed beat.</strong></p>
								<p>Ok, but what about the kind of music? What if you forget your music in the gym and you have to listen to whatever’s on? Well there aren’t any studies that looked at Enya or Hank Williams but they did look at the usual fitness centre pop music refrain. Apparently, over a moderately high intensity (75%) on a treadmill for 20 minutes, people generally perform no differently and feel no different whether they bring their own music or listen to whatever is on.</p>
								<p><strong>So if Haile Gebrselassie is there beside you getting his Scatman on, you might as well just go with it even if it’s not your groove!</strong> Of course this may not hold true for very long endurance sessions but it seems that putting on a random list of upbeat songs may do a similar job to your well-groomed playlist.</p>
								<h3>What if you’re a sprinter?</h3>
								<p>Anecdotally, I personally felt that music always helped my 30-60 second efforts but nothing shorter. One study showed that music doesn’t really impact on sprint performance or perceived exertion in very short running sprints (35m all out). Others demonstrated a clear improvement in both power output and perceived exertion in 30 second cycle sprints (in this context, the perceived exertion is to what extent you feel like passing out after 30 seconds at max power!). So it may help, it may not – it probably depends on what you call a sprint in your training.</p>
								<h3>What's the take home message?</h3>
								<ul style="list-style-type:square">
									<li>Haile Gebrselassie has a go-to song for his tough sessions – you probably should too.</li>
									<li>Race number visible at all times.</li>
									<li>If you forget your headphones in the gym, the music they blast out will probably suffice to motivate you for most sessions.</li>
									<li>Training with music BPM synced to your cadence (loads of podcasts and sites out there for this) may improve running economy. If you don’t like running with music, maybe you could try taking the metronome from the piano?!</li>
								</ul>
