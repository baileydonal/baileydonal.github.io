						<p>This page contains all of the information you should need for race day.</p>
						<p>UPDATE on 15/06/2017</p>
						<p><strong>The weather forecast is in for this weekend and it's set to be a scorcher, with temps up to 26 degrees and humidity of 75-85%!!!</strong></p>
						<p>While we all love sunshine in Ireland, the Barrow Trail can get very hot in places, with little wind in sheltered parts and heat reflected from the water.So with that in mind ...... here are a few points to consider!</p>
						
						<p><strong>1. Bring a Bottle / Hydration Pack!</strong></p>
						<p>Carrying a bottle or hydration pack is part of the mandatory gear checklist (see RacePack) for Ultras and Marathoners. These can be easily refilled at checkpoints. Considering the temperatures forecast we strongly recommend that half-marathoners also carry a bottle that can be refilled at aid stations and carried with you.</p>

						<p><strong>2. Dehydration, overhydration and getting it right!</strong></p>
						<p>There is a huge volume of misinformation out there about hydration during exercise and racing. In the 1950's people were actively discouraged from drinking during sport, even marathons! Then in the 1970's to 1990's people were advised to drink as much as they could, at least 900-1200mls of water for every hour of exercise, with no suggestion that body size, sweat rate, environmental factors etc had any part to play .....this lead to a massive increase in cases of overhydration (exercise-associated hyponatraemia) with serious consequences including confusion, coma, seizures and death.</p>
						<p>Today, the simplest and safest guide to follow, as recommended by The International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus, is to <strong>DRINK TO THIRST.</strong></p>
						<p>(For the more seasoned runners among you, we appreciate you may have a tried and tested and more personalised approach to your race nutrition and hydration, we do not intend on replacing that!)</p>

						<p><strong>3. Check Point Supplies</strong></p>
						<p>For those who like to know in advance, we have water, mi-wadi, crisps, nuts, oreos, fig rolls, jafa cakes and jellies at the check points.</p>
						<p>We have a Leave No Trace Policy, so drinks will be provided in cups to reduce littering along the course....again, if you want to have water with you while you run, bring your bottle or hydration pack!</p>

						<p><strong>4. Wear Sun Screen kids!</strong></p>

						<p><strong>5. Buses from Finish at Graiguenamanagh back to Carlow Car Park</strong></p>
						<p>For all runners, these can be purchased online or at registration for €10.</p>

						<p><strong>And with that, we will see you all for a bright, fun, glorious run on Saturday!</strong></p>
						
						<p>*****************************************************************************************</p>

						<p>Please also download the <a href="files/racepack.pdf">Race Pack</a> with all necessary info and check our FAQ and Facebook page if you want to know more.</p>
						<p><strong>The meeting point, registration, and race briefing for all distances is at Carlow Town Hall.</strong></p>
						<p><strong>Ultra-Marathon (57km):</strong> The Ultra-Marathon will have a slight route change this year. The race starts in Carlow Town Park and proceeds along the banks of the River Barrow for 57km. This will take runners to the beautiful and unspoiled St Mullins with a short loop back to Graiguenamanagh. We feel this is one of the most stunning parts of the route; you should enjoy the out and back immensely. There will be 6 aid stations/checkpoints.</p>
						<p><strong>Marathon (42.2km):</strong> The classic Barrow Valley Marathon route starts in Carlow Town Park and meanders pleasantly along the River Barrow to finish 42.2km away in Graiguenamanagh. There are 4 aid stations/checkpoints along the route.</p>
						<p><strong>Half-Marathon (21.1km):</strong>The Half-Marathon starts south of Bagenalstown, Co. Carlow. Note: The meeting point and registration is Carlow Town Hall. From there, buses will take runners to the race start (20 minutes). There is minimal parking available at the Half-Marathon start point. There will be 2 aid stations/checkpoints.</p>

It should be possible to carry all of the mandatory kit in a modest sized waist or back pack.</p>
